# Python French Law Library

This folder contains a ready-to-use Python library featuring French public
algorithms coded up in Catala.

The Python version expected to run the Python code is above 3.6. For the commands
noted below to run, you are expected to setup a virtual Python environment with
`virtualenv` by running the `setup_env.sh` script.

## Organization

### Law source

The `src/` folder contains the Python files generated by the Catala compiler.
To update them from the Catala sources, invoke this command from the root
of the repository:

```
make generate_french_law_library_python
```

The Python files generated by the Catala compiler expect the presence of the
`src/catala.py` file which contains the definitions of the values and operations
used by the generated code.

All theses Python files feature type annotations which can be checked against
using

```
make make type_french_law_library_python
```

### Wrappers

To use the algorithms in `src/`, you can take a look at the example provided in
`main.py`. It is very important to wrap all of the input parameters using
`src/catala.py` conversion functions.

You can benchmark the computation using

```
make run_french_law_library_benchmark_python
```
